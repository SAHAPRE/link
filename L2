[12/01, 1:07 pm] Mannuu 🥰❤️🧿: 1. Build Failure in Jenkins Pipeline

📍 Scenario: A Jenkins job frequently fails during the build phase.

📌 Question: How would you approach troubleshooting the build failure?

✅ Review the Jenkins console output to identify the exact error message.

✅ Check for issues like missing dependencies, incorrect configuration, or environment setup.

✅ Ensure Jenkinsfile syntax is correct, and verify build scripts and tools are installed correctly on build agents.

2. Deployment Fails Due to Environment Mismatch

📍Scenario: A deployment to a staging environment works, but it fails in production.

📌 Question: How do you identify and fix the issue?

✅ Compare environment variables, configuration files, and infrastructure (e.g., database versions, libraries).

✅ Ensure that production and staging environments are as identical as possible.

✅ Use configuration management tools to ensure consistency.

3. Pipeline Hangs at a Certain Step

📍Scenario: A CI/CD pipeline hangs or times out at a particular step.

📌 Question: How do you go about diagnosing the issue?

✅ Check logs for the step in question for any error messages.

✅ Identify if there is a resource bottleneck (e.g., insufficient memory or disk space).

✅ Increase pipeline timeouts and check if the pipeline depends on external services that might be slow or unresponsive.

4. Flaky Test Failures in Pipeline

📍Scenario: Tests are sometimes passing and sometimes failing in the pipeline, with no code changes.

📌 Question: How would you handle flaky tests?

✅ Analyze the test failure patterns to see if specific tests or resources are causing intermittent issues.

✅ Investigate potential race conditions, data dependency, or unstable external services.

✅ Consider isolating flaky tests or running them in different environments for reproducibility.

5. Permission Denied Errors

📍 Scenario: The pipeline fails due to permission denied errors during deployment.

📌 Question: How do you troubleshoot permission errors in the CI/CD pipeline?

✅ Verify user permissions for accessing resources (e.g., file system, APIs, databases).

✅ Check the permission configurations for the CI/CD runner and verify correct deployment keys or tokens.

✅ Ensure the correct user or service account is being used during deployment.

6. Slow Performance of CI/CD Pipeline

📍 Scenario: The CI/CD pipeline is running much slower than expected.

📌 Question: What are the steps to optimize and troubleshoot slow performance?

✅ Identify bottlenecks by analyzing each stage’s execution time in the pipeline.

✅ Parallelize jobs where possible, optimize build and test stages, and consider caching dependencies.

✅ Monitor and profile the infrastructure used in the pipeline (e.g., build agents, containers).

7. Artifact Deployment Fails Due to Version Conflict

📍 Scenario: A deployment fails due to version conflicts in dependencies.

📌 Question: How would you approach troubleshooting a dependency version conflict in the pipeline?

✅ Examine the dependency tree for conflicting versions of libraries or packages.

✅ Update the dependency management system (e.g., Maven, npm) to resolve conflicts or use dependency locking techniques.

✅ Ensure proper versioning of artifacts in your CI/CD pipeline.

8. Security Vulnerabilities Found During Pipeline Execution

📍 Scenario: A security scanning tool in the pipeline identifies vulnerabilities.

📌 Question: How would you handle vulnerabilities detected in the pipeline?

✅ Prioritize and analyze the vulnerabilities reported by the security tool (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk).

✅ Patch or upgrade affected dependencies and review code for security misconfigurations.

✅ Automate vulnerability detection and remediation workflows within the pipeline.

9. Failed Rollback During Deployment

📍 Scenario: A rollback operation fails after a deployment issue.

📌 Question: How do you handle a failed rollback during deployment?

✅ Investigate the cause of rollback failure (e.g., mismatched application state, improper rollback scripts).

✅ Ensure rollback procedures are tested as thoroughly as deployments.

✅ Implement versioned, atomic, and reversible deployment practices (e.g., blue-green deployment, feature toggles).

10. Docker Image Fails to Build

📍 Scenario: The pipeline fails at the Docker build step.

📌 Question: How would you troubleshoot a Docker image build failure?

✅ Review the Docker build logs for specific build errors, such as missing dependencies or misconfigured Dockerfiles.

✅ Check for build context issues, Dockerfile syntax, or network-related problems.

✅ Ensure that the correct base image and dependencies are used, and rebuild layers if necessary.

11. Service Not Accessible After Deployment

📍 Scenario: A service is not accessible after deployment even though it is running.

📌 Question: How do you troubleshoot this issue?

✅ Check the network configuration (firewall, DNS, routing) and ensure ports are open and properly mapped.

✅ Verify the service’s health using monitoring tools (e.g., Kubernetes health checks, Docker logs).

✅ Ensure proper load balancer or proxy configurations, if applicable.

12. Failed Integration Between CI/CD Tools

📍 Scenario: The CI/CD pipeline is integrated with tools like Git, Jira, and Slack, but integrations are failing.

📌 Question: How do you identify the root cause of the integration failure?

✅ Verify connection settings (e.g., API keys, authentication credentials) between CI/CD tools (e.g., Git, Jira, Slack).

✅ Check for recent updates or changes to the integration services (e.g., APIs, webhooks).

✅ Review logs and trace errors to identify integration points causing the failure.
