There were days I doubted myself, days when the journey felt longer, and I had no idea what to do.
From countless Applications, rejections, sleepless study nights, interviews that didn’t work out, and questioning myself repeatedly.
It’s really a long battle.
But somewhere inside, I knew one thing- Don’t Wish for It, Work for it…
Today, I’m truly happy to share that I have started a new role as a Senior Infra Developer at Cognizant.
And so finally Wrapping 2025 and welcoming 2026 with new challenges, new Skills, and new Experiences. Its not just a start of a new year but also a new job, a new role --- It’s the beginning of a dream I’ve worked hard for.
Let’s the Journey begins!
Thank You 2025 for this beautiful Journey!
